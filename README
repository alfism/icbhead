This code was originally derived from the old Python icb client code from
 http://a.armory.com/~zenomt/icb.py

I have no idea what the license on that is.  So until I find out,
there is no real license on this.  Use it at your own risk.

I'll sort that out later, I'd like to Apache 2 license the entire thing.
