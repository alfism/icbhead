This code was originally derived from the old Python icb client code from
 http://a.armory.com/~zenomt/icb.py

I have no idea what the license on that is.  So until I find out,
there is no real license on this.  Use it at your own risk.

I'll sort that out later, I'd like to Apache 2 license the entire thing.

Status:
* bare bones, differences from the old icb.py so far are:
  - Requires Python 3.1 or later to run.
    (how's that for keeping the rabble away?)
  - No longer word wraps long lines coming from other people as open
    messages as that breaks URLs.
  - Does word wrap your own longer than 239 char lines into multiple
    messages.  Up to 2x that limit anyways (don't be line spammy).
  - Does shorten long URLs in your own lines using goo.gl.
